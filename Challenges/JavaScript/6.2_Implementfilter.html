  <h1>Implementing Filter</h1>
  <p>Map and filter are common functional programming methods that you have most
    likely used when coding. They are both functions that take in a list,
    perform some operation on that list without changing the original list,
    and then return a new lists. The functions do not change any other
    variables and do not touch anything else except those lists they were given.
    We are going to implement our own.</p>
  <p>Filter works by taken a list and making some kind of filter, in other
    words, a condicional statment. Then ii will create a new list with the
    items that pass this condition. Our list is [-2, 4, 5, 8, -44, -6]
    We will delete the negative numbers. </p>

  <!-- Now we can try the map function with some functions -->

  <!-- Button to trigger the function -->
  <button type="button" onclick="showResult();">Try it!</button>

  <script>
  //We create very simple function using arrow functions, that is a easiest and
  //simple way to create a function that the usual form. To know more:
  // http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_arrow-functions.html

  //Create the function to check if it is a positive number
  var isPositive = (x) => x>0;

  //Call the function and show the result
      function showResult() {

        //Array declaration
        let arr = [-2, 4, 5, 8, -44, -6];

        //Call our map funciton
        let result = myFilter(arr,isPositive);

        //We call to the HTML documento to show our result on the page
        document.getElementById("showresult").innerHTML = result;
      }

  </script>

  <!-- Our result -->
  <p id="showresult"> </p>
