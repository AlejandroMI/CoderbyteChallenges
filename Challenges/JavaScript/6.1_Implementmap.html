  <h1>Implementing Map</h1>
  <p>Map and filter are common functional programming methods that you have most
    likely used when coding. They are both functions that take in a list,
    perform some operation on that list without changing the original list,
    and then return a new lists. The functions do not change any other
    variables and do not touch anything else except those lists they were given.
    We are going to implement our own.</p>
  <p>Map works by taking a list and a function, and it applies the function to
    each element in the list and returns a new list. Our list is [1,2,3,4]
    We will compute the square of this array. </p>

  <!-- Now we can try the map function with some functions -->

  <!-- Button to trigger the function -->
  <button type="button" onclick="showResult();">Try it!</button>

  <script>
  //We create very simple function using arrow functions, that is a easiest and
  //simple way to create a function that the usual form. To know more:
  // http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_arrow-functions.html

  //The following function will be the same that use:
  // function square(x){return x*x;}
  var square = (x) => x*x;

  //Here is another one:
  //What we do is to add a pair of zeros to the input and then return the
  //value as an integer, using parseInt.
  var addZeros = (x) => parseInt(x += '00')


  //Call the function and show the result
      function showResult() {

        //Array declaration
        let arr = [1,2,3,4];

        //Call our map funciton
        let result = myMap(arr,square);

        //We call to the HTML documento to show our result on the page
        document.getElementById("showresult").innerHTML = result;
      }

  </script>

  <!-- Our result -->
  <p id="showresult"> </p>
