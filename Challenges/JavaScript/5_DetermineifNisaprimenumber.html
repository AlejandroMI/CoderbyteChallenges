  //Here is important to know that is called prime beacuse we can only obtain
//this number by multiplying the number itself per 1. What leads to the other type
//of numbers: compounds ones, like 16(4*4)(8*2), but not 11(11*1). By general
//agreement the 1 is not either prime or compund. So we should implement this
//in our algorithm. Then, we could try to see if (n) result in modulus 0
//anytime from 2 to n-1, what will mean that is a compund number. But in order
//to reduce compute time, we can only compute from 2 to the square of n. We can
//do this beacuse if its a compund number one of the multipliers will be always
//less than the square of n.

    //loop until this number checking if the modulus equals to zero.

  <h1>Determine if N is a prime number</h1>
  <p>This is a classic coding questins that asks you to write a program to
    determine whether or not some input N is a prime number. A prime number is
    a number that is divisible only by 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers
    are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 17, ...</p>
  <p> Please, enter a number to check if it is a prime number </p>

  <!--  Now we use a intup to leave the user enter n-->
  <!-- To learn about inputs follow this link:
