  //the most intuitive way to solve this problem.
  //That is to simply loop through the array and for each element check if
  //there is a second element that when both are summed are equal to S.
  //This will require us to write a nested loop.[1] This solution will run in O(n2)
  //Ii is so much better if we use a HASH table that runs only in O(n)

  function twoSum(arr,S) {

    let hashTable = {};

    //we obtain every number in the array
    for (let i=0; i<arr.length; i++){

      //So what we are gonna do now is to obtain the result of minus the
      //number in position i to the total sum S. By doing this we will obtain
      //the secon number needed to finally obtain S.
      let sumMinusElement = S - arr[i];

      //Now is time to check if the result is already in our hashTable, what will
      //mean that there is two numbers on the array that sum S.

      if(hashTable[sumMinusElement] !== undefined){
        return true;
      }

      //If is not in the hashTable, we will add the actual number arr[i] to
      //the table.

  <h1> Two sum problem </h1>
  <p> You are given an array and some number S.
    Determine if any two numbers within the array sum to S.  </p>
  <p> In this case the array is [4,7,13,2,8,1,22]. You can input S </p>

  <!-- To learn about inputs follow this link:
